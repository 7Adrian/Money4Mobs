## How to set up a custom kill message
To add spaces to your message, '|' symbol needs to be added. 
1.16.* ONLY --- Colors are the the default Minecraft colors and are uppercased and surrounded by '%' symbols
In order to display the amount rewarded to the player upon mob kill, use '%AMOUNT%'
In order to display the balance of the player after being rewarded the money, use '%BALANCE%'
Each word or value needs to be separated by a space. Adding a space does not equate to a space in the result
#### Examples
* 1.) customMessage: '%GREEN% Rewarded | %GOLD% $ %AMOUNT% | %GREEN% and | now | have | %GOLD% $ %BALANCE% %GREEN% .'
 * 1 - Result) "Rewarded $10 and now have $100."
* 2.) customMessage: '%GREEN% Rewarded %GOLD% $ %AMOUNT% | %GREEN% and | now have | %GOLD% $ %BALANCE% %GREEN% | .'
 * 2 - Result) "Rewarded$10 and nowhave $100 ."
